/**
 * <p>Notifies Amazon ECR that you intend to upload an image layer.</p>
 *         <p>When an image is pushed, the InitiateLayerUpload API is called once per image layer
 *             that has not already been uploaded. Whether or not an image layer has been uploaded is
 *             determined by the BatchCheckLayerAvailability API action.</p>
 *         <note>
 *             <p>This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by
 *         customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should use the <code>docker</code> CLI to pull, tag, and push images.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ECRClient, InitiateLayerUploadCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ecr"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ECRClient, InitiateLayerUploadCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ecr"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ECRClient(config);
 * const command = new InitiateLayerUploadCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link InitiateLayerUploadCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link InitiateLayerUploadCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ECRClientResolvedConfig | config} for ECRClient's `config` shape.
