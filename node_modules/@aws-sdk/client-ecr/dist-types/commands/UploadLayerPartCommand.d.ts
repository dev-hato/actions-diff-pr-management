/**
 * <p>Uploads an image layer part to Amazon ECR.</p>
 *         <p>When an image is pushed, each new image layer is uploaded in parts. The maximum size
 *             of each image layer part can be 20971520 bytes (or about 20MB). The UploadLayerPart API
 *             is called once per each new image layer part.</p>
 *         <note>
 *             <p>This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by
 *         customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should use the <code>docker</code> CLI to pull, tag, and push images.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ECRClient, UploadLayerPartCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ecr"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ECRClient, UploadLayerPartCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ecr"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ECRClient(config);
 * const command = new UploadLayerPartCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link UploadLayerPartCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link UploadLayerPartCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ECRClientResolvedConfig | config} for ECRClient's `config` shape.
