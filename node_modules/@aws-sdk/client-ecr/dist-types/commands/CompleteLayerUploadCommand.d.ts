/**
 * <p>Informs Amazon ECR that the image layer upload has completed for a specified registry,
 *             repository name, and upload ID. You can optionally provide a <code>sha256</code> digest
 *             of the image layer for data validation purposes.</p>
 *         <p>When an image is pushed, the CompleteLayerUpload API is called once per each new image
 *             layer to verify that the upload has completed.</p>
 *         <note>
 *             <p>This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by
 *         customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should use the <code>docker</code> CLI to pull, tag, and push images.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ECRClient, CompleteLayerUploadCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ecr"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ECRClient, CompleteLayerUploadCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ecr"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ECRClient(config);
 * const command = new CompleteLayerUploadCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CompleteLayerUploadCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CompleteLayerUploadCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ECRClientResolvedConfig | config} for ECRClient's `config` shape.
