/**
 * <p>Launches the specified Scheduled Instances.</p>
 *          <p>Before you can launch a Scheduled Instance, you must purchase it and obtain an identifier using <a>PurchaseScheduledInstances</a>.</p>
 *          <p>You must launch a Scheduled Instance during its scheduled time period. You can't stop or reboot a Scheduled Instance,
 *          but you can terminate it as needed. If you terminate a Scheduled Instance before the current scheduled time period ends,
 *          you can launch it again after a few minutes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-scheduled-instances.html">Scheduled Instances</a>
 *          in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, RunScheduledInstancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, RunScheduledInstancesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new RunScheduledInstancesCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link RunScheduledInstancesCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link RunScheduledInstancesCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
