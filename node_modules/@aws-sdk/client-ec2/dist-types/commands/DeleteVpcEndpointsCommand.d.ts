/**
 * <p>Deletes one or more specified VPC endpoints. You can delete any of the following types of VPC endpoints.  </p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Gateway endpoint,</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Gateway Load Balancer endpoint,</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Interface endpoint</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *         <p>The following rules apply when you delete a VPC endpoint:</p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>When you delete a gateway endpoint, we delete the endpoint routes in the route tables that are associated with the endpoint.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>When you delete a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, we delete the endpoint network interfaces. </p>
 *                 <p>You can only delete Gateway Load Balancer endpoints when the routes that are associated with the endpoint are deleted.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>When you delete an interface endpoint, we delete the  endpoint network interfaces.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, DeleteVpcEndpointsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, DeleteVpcEndpointsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new DeleteVpcEndpointsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteVpcEndpointsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteVpcEndpointsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
