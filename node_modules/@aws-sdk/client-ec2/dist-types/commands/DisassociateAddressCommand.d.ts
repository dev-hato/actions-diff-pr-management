 * <p>Disassociates an Elastic IP address from the instance or network interface it's associated with.</p>
 * 			      <p>An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. For more
 * 			information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP
 * 				Addresses</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, DisassociateAddressCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, DisassociateAddressCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new DisassociateAddressCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DisassociateAddressCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DisassociateAddressCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
